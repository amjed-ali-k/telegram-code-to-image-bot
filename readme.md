# Telegram Code Beautifier Bot

Telegram Code Beautifier Bot is a Telegram bot that beautifies code snippets by generating an image of the code with the Carbon API. The bot adds user information such as name, username, and avatar to the image and sends it back to the user. The bot is built with Node.js and the Telegraf library.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply send a code snippet to the bot and it will send back an image of the code with your name, username, and avatar added to the image. You can use the bot in private chats or group chats by mentioning the bot or replying to a message by mentioning the bot.
